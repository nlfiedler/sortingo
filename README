Sorting for Go
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the source distribution of a sorting package for the Go
programming language (http://golang.org), named sortingo, which contains
various sorting algorithm implementations.

For more details, see http://code.google.com/p/burstsort4j/

Sortingo is built using the `make` tool commonly available on platforms
which support Go development. Without a target, make will build the
package and auxillary commands, while the 'test' target will run the
unit tests, and 'clean' will remove all build-generated files.

Unless otherwise noted, the Sortingo source files are distributed under
the BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.
