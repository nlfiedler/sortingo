This is the source distribution of a sorting library for Go, named
sortingo, which contains various sorting algorithm implementations.

To build, use the `make` tool commonly available on Go supported
platforms. With no target, make will build the library, while the 'test'
target will run the unit tests, and 'clean' will remove all generated
files.

Unless otherwise noted, the Sortingo source files are distributed under
the BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.
